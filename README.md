# Pixel-Meet
A cute game I made for my beautiful, intelligent, and wonderful wife chronicling the meeting of Daniela and Luke as a pixelated character,
watch as love envelops you, believe it as your friendly cat NPCs, and make it come true with Pixel Meet! 

INSTRUCTIONS: Click code, download ZIP, extract zip in a Singular file (all files must be together for the game to
run properly), run the game by clicking index.html.

P.S - I love ya Daniela!

## Browser Interaction and Security

Pixel-Meet runs entirely in the browser with local scripts and assets only. The game does not make any
network requests or process user data beyond simple keyboard controls for movement. This approach
reduces attack surface and helps maintain a secure runtime environment. It also aligns with the
[Oracle Secure Coding Guidelines](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/seccode/seccode1.html)
recommendations for fundamentals and input validation by minimizing potential external input and not
trusting data from outside sources.
