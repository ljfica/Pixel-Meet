# Pixel-Meet
A cute game I made for my beatiful wife chronicling the meeting of Daniela and Luke as a pixelated character,
watch as love envelops you, believe it as your friendly cat NPCs, and make it come true with Pixel Meet! 

INSTRUCTIONS: Click code, download ZIP, extract zip in a Singular file (all files must be together for the game to
run properly), run the game by clicking index.html. 

P.S - I love ya Daniela!
